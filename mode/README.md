This package implements a collection of ported [stream
language](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref#stream-parser) modes for
the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/6/) code editor. Each mode is
available as a separate script file, under
`"@codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/[name]"`, and exports the values
listed below.

The [project page](https://codemirror.net/6/) has more information, a
number of [examples](https://codemirror.net/6/examples/) and the
[documentation](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/).

This code is released under an
[MIT license](https://github.com/codemirror/legacy-modes/tree/main/LICENSE).

We aim to be an inclusive, welcoming community. To make that explicit,
we have a [code of
conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/) that applies
to communication around the project.
